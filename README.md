# eLab Beer Quality Tester
This study presented a research-driven design and prototyping process to build an end-to-end system that uses an Arduino microcontroller embedding gas sensors, network module, product ID selector and power management , a trained AI model to read low data captured by the gas sensors and predict beer quality value
the aim of project is to develop an affordable IoT based Device that can support banana beer processors and users to determine  homemade beer quality  anytime and anywhere and create cloud data storage for future use and further analysis of the products. 
The experimentation carried out on local banana beer product shows that the proposed system achieves a 89% of accuracy for biochemical parameters  detection.
